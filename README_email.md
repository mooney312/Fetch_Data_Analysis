**Fourth: Communicate with Stakeholders**

Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who isn’t familiar with your day to day work. 
This part of the exercise should show off how you communicate and reason about data with others. Commit your answers to the git repository along with the rest of your exercise.

    What questions do you have about the data?
    How did you discover the data quality issues?
    What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?
    What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?
    What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?
